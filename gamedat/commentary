# Game commentary source.

ABOUT: Welcome to the commentary track!

objtree-legend: In this list, `Rooms` are rooms and `Items` are regular items. (Sometimes portable, sometimes not.)
	`Scen` indicates scenery objects. These exist in multiple places; for example, the [obj:WHITE-HOUSE] is visible from many outdoor locations.
	`Glob` indicates a global object, which is *always* visible, or at least mentionable. For example, [obj:GRUE] is global – not because grues are always present, but so you can always ask `WHAT IS A GRUE`.

obj:adventurer: Yes, the player’s printed name is “cretin”, although the game rarely says so. (The death message for `BURN BOOK` mentions it too.) This sort of sarcastic insult hasn’t aged too well, but MIT culture had a lot of it. Compare [*glob:WINNER], and also the old MIT [Jargon File|https://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.0.0.33.dos.txt].
	Note that if you refer to `ME` (or `CRETIN`), you get the [*obj:ME] global object, not the `ADVENTURER`.

obj:me: A global object which is always in scope. Commands referring to `ME` hit this, rather than [*obj:ADVENTURER], which is a stub that moves around the map.
	Because of this, parser messages mostly refer to you as “you”, even though the `ADVENTURER`’s printed name is “cretin”. See [*obj:ADVENTURER].

glob:player: `PLAYER` is always the [obj:ADVENTURER]. Compare [*glob:WINNER].

glob:winner: `WINNER` is the actor in the current command. (Compare [*glob:PLAYER].) 
	`WINNER` is usually [obj:ADVENTURER], but for a command like `ROBOT, GO EAST` it shifts to the named NPC. (But Zork 1 has no commandable NPCs, so this doesn’t come up.)
	“Winner” is just as sarcastic as “cretin”, but from the other side.
### [cretin|*obj:adventurer] ?

glob:here: The location of the [glob:WINNER].

obj:songbird: The songbird is always present but never in reach. Except when using the [obj:CANARY], and even then the bird flies away before you can interact with it.
