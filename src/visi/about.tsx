                <p>
                    You are playing Zork, the classic Infocom text adventure.
                    And you are watching the Z-machine execute the game,
                    live, as you play.

                <p>

                    a quick intro</a>.)
                    As the game responds, the panes on the right will display
                    the current game state and the code that is
                    executing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at the

                    shows the state of the world &#x2014; the 158 global variables
                    at least. (Objects have property variables
                    as well, which you can view from the World tab.)

                <h2>Which Zork is this?</h2>
                <p>
                    The first version of Zork was written in 1977 by energetic
                    MIT students, in a LISP-y language called MDL. A few
                    years later, as part of Infocom, they rewrote it &#x2014; 
                    piecewise &#x2014; with a homebrew portable tool they called{' '}
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/what-is-zil-anyway">ZIL</a>.
                    (For &#x201C;
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/what-is-zil-anyway">Zork Implementation Language</a>
                    &#x201D;.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The version you see here dates from 1984. (The serial number
                    &#x201C;840726&#x201D; shows the compile date.) By this point,
                    the Infocom folks had combined the common parts of
                    Zork 1, 2, and 3 into a common library.
                    This library, containing the
                    parser and generic action code, was shared with (almost)
                    no changes between the three games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The common library (the files &#x201C;gverbs.zil&#x201D;,
                    &#x201C;gparser.zil&#x201D;, etc) did contain bits of
                    code specific to each of the three games. (For example,
                    the game title banners printed in{' '}
                    <code><a className="Internal" href="#" onClick={ (ev)=>evhan_click_routine(ev, 'V-VERSION') }>V-VERSION</a></code>.)
                    The passages meant for Zork 2 and 3 were skipped when
                    compiling Zork 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This &#x201C;renovated&#x201D; 1984 release is
                    the one most commonly seen today,
                    because it was included in the &#x201C;
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/lost-treasures-of-infocom">Lost Treasures of Infocom</a>
                    &#x201D; collection and later collections.
                    I have therefore selected it for this exhibit.
                    That was not the final version, however. In 1987
                    Infocom released the &#x201C;Solid Gold&#x201D; edition with
                    built-in InvisiClues. Archived evidence indicates that
                    they continued updating the source well into 1988.

                    Zork itself was originally written by Tim Anderson,
                    Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling. The
                    commercial versions are copyright 1981 (etc) by Infocom,
                    then Activision, then renamed to Mediagenic,
                    then Bobby Kotick bought it and renamed it Activision,
                    then Vivendi bought it and merged it with Blizzard,
                    then Microsoft consumed the lot. Got it? Good.
