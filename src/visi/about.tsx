                    You are playing Zork, the classic Infocom text adventure.
                    And you are watching the Z-machine execute the game,
                    live, as you play.

                <p>

                    a quick intro</a>.)
                    As the game responds, the panes on the right will display
                    the current game state and the code that is
                    executing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at the

                    tab for a start.
                    This shows every object and room in the game.

                    shows the functions called in
                    the most recent turn, and what they printed.

                    shows the state of the world &#x2014; the 158 global variables
                    at least. (Objects have property variables
                    as well, which you can view from the World tab.)

                <h2>Which Zork is this?</h2>
                <p>
                    The first version of Zork was written in 1977 by energetic
                    MIT students, in a LISP-y language called MDL. A few
                    years later, as part of Infocom, they rewrote it &#x2014; 
                    piecewise &#x2014; with a homebrew portable tool they called{' '}
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/what-is-zil-anyway">ZIL</a>.
                    (For &#x201C;
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/what-is-zil-anyway">Zork Implementation Language</a>
                    &#x201D;.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The version you see here dates from 1984. (The serial number
                    &#x201C;840726&#x201D; shows the compile date.) By this point,
                    the Infocom folks had combined the common parts of
                    Zork 1, 2, and 3 &#x2014; the parser and generic actions &#x2014;
                    into a (roughly) common library shared between the
                    three games. You'll see quite a bit of code which
                    is meant for Zork 2 or 3; these segments are compiled
                    out (inactive) for Zork 1.

                <p>
                    This 1984 release is the one most commonly seen today,
                    because it was included in the &#x201C;
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/lost-treasures-of-infocom">Lost Treasures of Infocom</a>
                    &#x201D; collection and later collections.
                    I have therefore selected it for this exhibit.
                    That was not the final version, however. In 1987
                    Infocom released the &#x201C;Solid Gold&#x201D; edition with
                    built-in InvisiClues. Archived evidence indicates that
                    they continued updating the source well into 1988.
